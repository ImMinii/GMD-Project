# BlogPost 2 - Design Document & Milestones

### Codename: Frenemies

We are in a group of two making a co-op game with the primary genre being metroidvania. This game will be 2d puzzle platformer explorer similar to “Animal well” and “Ori and the blind forest”. The mechanics of this game is inspired by the game “Bread and Fred”, specifically the rope mechanic where the 2 players are always connected to each other. Each player will have the ability to move around, jump, wall jumping, climb on a rope/pole and pull their partners robe. The world and camera movement shows one small section of the entire map and the camera only moves into a different section if the players moves into that section, making the puzzles mostly one screen puzzles. To make the game more dynamic the players will be able to choose some power ups/abilities that they can find around the world, however these abilities can only be chosen by one of the players. This will create the puzzling self discovery of what combination will create the solution for a particular kind of puzzle. By this the aesthetics for the players will be:  
_Fellowship_ and _cooperation_ for creating a social game with a friend that will hopefully not become an enemy by any frustrating mechanics

_Expression_ and _discovery_ by creating a world it rewards you for collecting items and collectables for the end goal

_Challenge_ by creating puzzles

### Power ups

We have brainstormed some ideas for the power-ups that the players can have, but as said before only one player can have a specific power-up active at a time.

This list is incomplete and is likely to change.

- Sizing (Light Green)
- Dash (Pink)
- Double jump (Green)
- Featherfall (Blue)
- Throwing (Red)
- Light (Yellow)
- Freeze or slow time (Light blue)
- Speed time (Light yellow)

### Milestones

To make the process more tangible and approachable, we have made three milestones, which are as follows:

1. Physics and rope mechanic - Map and camera
2. Collectables (Power ups and rewards) mechanical, sound, graphics and animations,
3. World and level. Moving platforms, difficulty and puzzles, Menu, Collectables (In the world), inventory

The focus of the first is the basic mechanics of how the players interact with each other, such as how the rope keeps the players together within a certain radius. There is also the way the caramra is suppose to change when the players get to the edge of the screen to a new room, like in Animal Well.

The next we want to focus on is the power-ups and get their mechanics to work alone as well as how they interact with one another. In this milestone we also want to look at the more aesthetic aspects to make it more appealing to the consumer.

The last milestone is making the puzzles and incorporating the power-ups and the physics of the world to make these puzzles. Furthermore adding the menu and some form of collectables for the players to find in the world. An inventory where the player can choose a power-up and see the collectables they have.# GMD-Project
